# Processing PACE data with Python: get a polarized hyperspectral view of the Earth (EO Summer School 2025)
This file contains links to useful material as preparation for the summer school tutorial.

## Earthdata portal to download NASA data 
https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?portal=obdaac&q=pace  
On this site you can download data from multiple NASA Earth observation missions. An active [EARTHDATA login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) is required.

## Ocean Biology Processing Group portal  
The data from PACE (and other ocean color oriented missions) is processed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG).

https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/  
This is their home page.

https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/file_search/  
This is the OBPG portal for downloading data processed by OBPG.

https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/docs/tutorials/  
Here you can find useful tutorials (Jupyter notebooks) on processing PACE data from the OCI- and HARP2-instruments. This EO Summer School 2025 tutorial will focus on data from the SPEXone instrument.

## Quick and easy view of global data from multiple sensors
NASA's Worldview website allows visualizing Earth Observation data on a global map with fast zooming and navigation functionalities. The go-to website for identifying and searching for phenomena visible from space.

This link provides a view of PACE/OCI-data and shows the PACE ground track.

## General NetCDF file explorer
The Silx viewer is a nice tool to inspect to contents of NetCDF-files:
